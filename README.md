This is an app created during HackNY that I call Versona because it depicts Virtual Personality of the companies.

### What it does ###

By using glassdoor's api, I extracted the company's information and injected into IBM's supercomputer service,
Bluemix Watson - Personality Insights, which pushed back the results of the company's personality. This way, Venture 
Capitalists can easily find what company they want to invest in and job-seekers can find what kind of company they
want to work for. I used the IBM Watson Java api and modified it to make it work for my website.

Apis used:
  * IBM Bluemix Watson - Personality Insights
  * Glassdoor Api
  * Google Maps
